# Supervised Learning Classifiers Comparison

## Description
This project conducts a comparative analysis of three machine learning classifiers—Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM)—on three datasets from the UCI machine learning repository. The goal is to replicate and expand upon the methodologies outlined in Caruana and Niculescu-Mizil's empirical study, focusing on classification accuracy across various dataset partitions using cross-validation for hyper-parameter optimization.

## Datasets
The study uses the following UCI datasets:
- Auto MPG
- Car Evaluation
- Liver Disorders

Each dataset is preprocessed and analyzed to create a binary classification problem, aligning with the project's focus on two-class classifiers.
